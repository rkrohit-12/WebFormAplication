Web Form

Title of the Project:    WebFormAplication


Description: Difference between HTTP and XMLHTTP requests
HttpRequest is a server side object that represents a request to the server.
XMLHttpRequest in a standard javascript object that allows you to make HTTP Requests from the
browser in javascript.
In summary - one works in the browser, the other in the web server. They also have completely
different roles. XMLHttpRequest is for fetching web resources within the browser. HttpRequest
represents an incoming request.
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.
● Update a web page without reloading the page
● Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
● Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
● Send data to a server - in the background
Difference between type “SUBMIT” vs type “BUTTON”
<input type="button"> can be used anywhere, not just within form and they do not submit form if
they are in one. Much better suited with Javascript.
<input type="submit"> should be used in forms only and they will send a request (either GET or
POST) to specified URL. They should not be put in any HTML place.
What is AJAX
● AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
● AJAX is not a programming language.
● AJAX just uses a combination of:
○ A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
○ JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
